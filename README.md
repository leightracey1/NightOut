### APIs

TicketMaster API was used to find events based on criteria provided by the user around dates, a location, and a search keyword. The data retrieved is provided to the user to make getting tickets and information about it easy.


Google Maps API was used to show the events on a map, and when on is chosen to show all bars around that event's venue. Available information is provided to the user to call or visit their site to plan their night out.

### Technology Used

HTML/CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Materialize library


### App Flow

User enters start and end date for range of when they would like to go out.

User enters a city/state that the user would like to go out to.

User enters search keyword for the ticketmaster API to narrow the results of the other parameters.

Site shows all events given the user's inputs and shows venues for them on a map. User then will select an event he/she wants to go to.

Site will provide a list of bars in the area around the event's venue. Locations will also have markers for them appear on the map. User then selects a bar to go to either before or after the event.

Site provides additional information for tickets or reaching out to bar to make reservations if required.
